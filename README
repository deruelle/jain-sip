JAIN-SIP 1.2 Reference Implementation
--------------------------------------
CONTENTS
-------
See docs/index.html

BUILD Notes
-----------
Platforms:
---------
You need to install J2SE JDK 1.5 or above. You can
get the SDK from http://www.javasoft.com



Dependencies
------------

1. You need to install ant and the junit extension for ant on your machine.
2. You need to have junit.jar in your classpath.
3. You need to have log4j.jar in your classpath (included in this distribution).

There are versions of the dependent libraries in the lib directory.  
For your build environment, please edit ant-build-config.properties.

YOU DO NOT need jdom.jar and ant.jar. These are strictly for buildng 
the ant tools.

Building It from Scratch
-------------------------
The distribution is pre-built but should you feel inclined to make changes,
or run the examples, you may wish to rebuild everything.

ant make 

Builds everything.


Building the TCK
----------------

Edit tck.properties and set the claspath to your implementation.

ant runtck 

(builds a jar file containing the TCK and runs it).

Look in test-reports  to see the results of your run.

Extensions
----------

IMS Headers, headers in gov.nist.javax.sip.extension and all the classes that are
suffixed with Ext in their name can be used without concern as they will be included
in the next generation of the API.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the examples

Please ensure that the directory  classes  (relative to where you have
built the distribution) is included in the  classpath. Ant targets
are provided in each example directory to run the examples.

How to get Source Code Refreshes
--------------------------------

CVS Snapshot
------------

For those who cannot access CVS thanks to draconian IT administrative
policies, here is a HTTP url where a cruise control snapshot is grabbed
from the stable CVS repository and dumped:

http://download.java.net/communications/jain-sip/nightly/



----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CVS Access
----------

The "stable" cvs reposiotory is located on java.net. To download from CVS
(higly recommended), visit 

http://jain-sip.dev.java.net/



And follow the instructions there. 


You can browse the source code online here:

http://jain-sip.dev.java.net/source/browse/jain-sip/


Note that you need to be logged in to java.net in order to acces the source 
from cvs.
